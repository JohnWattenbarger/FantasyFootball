# FantasyFootball

This project was created to examine NFL statistics over the past 10 years and see how they relate to fantasy football. This
project also seeks to discover how different position scoring has changed over time. These relationships and changes in NFL statistics
were displayed using data visualization techniques.

### Files

##### PosterPDF.pdf

A poster I created to present this project at school. It gives an overview of what I did, and includes the main graphs that I created.

##### WebScrapping.R

An R script that I created that generates data tables with NFL statistics from the past 10 years. The data is taken from NFL.com and ESPN.com. There are also graphs generated in R that make the data easier to interpret.

##### BasicShiny.R

An R shiny application that contains the main graphs from WebScrapping.R and displays them interactively.

##### ShinyYears.R

Another R shiny application that gets users to choose a position, year, and stat category and then displays a graph plotting that stat against fantasy points.
